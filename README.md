QuickClips- Get Condensed video 

This system automatically generates a summarized video by extracting and combining the most important parts of a longer video. The input can be either a YouTube URL or a locally uploaded video file. The pipeline works in multiple steps:

Video Input – Users provide a YouTube link or upload a video file.

Audio Extraction & Transcription – The system extracts the audio, converts it into text, and aligns it with timestamps.

Summarization – Using NLP techniques (such as BERT), the transcript is analyzed to identify the main points.

Timestamp Mapping – Key points are matched with their corresponding timestamps in the original video.

Summarized Video Generation – The selected clips are stitched together to produce a concise, meaningful video summary.

The final output is a shortened video that highlights only the most relevant parts, saving time while retaining the core message.
